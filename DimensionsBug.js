This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get the screen dimensions.  The dimensions are initially incorrect or zero, particularly when accessed early in the component's lifecycle (e.g., within `componentDidMount` before the layout is fully rendered). This can lead to unexpected UI behavior, misaligned elements, or incorrect calculations based on screen size.
